# DESCRIPTION
This repository contains MATLAB functions and scripts, as well as Linux C-shell scripts, that I developed to facilitate image reconstruction with MRI data acquired by a specific non-Cartesian, 3D sampling pattern that I implemented on clinical MRI scanners.

* Any anatomical images featured here are of my own body, therefore, there is no HIPAA violation here.
